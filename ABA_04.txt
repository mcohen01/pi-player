A brief anecdote:  A man who lived in a suburban dwelling area was surprised one evening to see his neighbor bow to the four winds, chant a strange melody, and dance around his front lawn beating a small drum.

"Why do you go through this same ritual each evening?" the man asked his neighbor.  "It keeps my house safe from tigers," the neighbor replied. "Good grief!" the man said.  "Don't you know there isn"t a tiger within a thousand miles of here?"  "Yeah," the neighbor smiled.  "Sure ____ks, doesn"t it?"
