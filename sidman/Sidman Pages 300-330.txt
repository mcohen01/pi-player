2.   A steady state is the only alternative to a baseline of<br/>     transition.  If a transition state is not desired as a<br/>     baseline from which to initiate a second transition, the<br/>     experimenter must take every precaution to ensure that his<br/>     baseline behavior is maintained in the (transition/steady)<br/>     _______ state.  If he ignores this control, he is likely to<br/>     find that his data are not replicable.  Page 302<br/>

3.   In programmed instruction successive frames may supply added<br/>     formal prompts such as the answer word appearing elsewhere<br/>     with frames or, perhaps, help letters at the beginning or<br/>     end of blanks.  The objective is to get the student to<br/>     respond to subtle thematic prompting rather than _____l<br/>     prompts because the behavior is more likely to _______lize<br/>     to non-instructional conditions.  Over successive frames<br/>     control shifts from formal prompts to thematic stimuli. <br/>     This is called a _______ state.  Page 303<br/>

He introduced lights which were of<br/>     different wave-length lights than the discriminative<br/>     stimulus during conditioning, and revealed the a<br/>     generalization gradient.  Sidman used the same procedure but<br/>     used click rates and avoidance behavior.  Sidman revealed<br/>     similar generalization gradient results.
