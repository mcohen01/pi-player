If the RU contains technical terms or new vocabulary, the student may need to copy the technical terms.  The frame type that presents the same RU twice and forces the student to copy one or more technical terms is the ______ frame type.

Although novice programmers usually include many of them, RU + RU* copy frames should be used sparingly.  Copy frames contain maximum stimulus support, and the goal of programming is to get the student to respond (with/without) ______ stimulus support.
