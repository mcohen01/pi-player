{"feedback":"No, cos I has no printer.  But I did save it as a pdf, once again.  I'll admit I am lazy and have not fully read them, because I know exactly what you are talking about.  Actually, not only do I not have a job, but right now, no one in my family 'has a job' per se; we all make money in different ways, whatever opportunities are given to us; I sometimes sell my artwork, sometimes collaborate on commissions with my brother, cat-sit, etc.  Once I learned how to tile with a professional tiler, and he gave me a little money for my trouble.  I try to stick to things that are enriching my own experience of life, and hopefully others', as well, and nothing too abstract.  I am working towards having the resources I require to set up gardens and other materials on our property in upstate NY; I would hope to create a community of artists there, and support all of my friends who have similar qualms with 'the money trap'.\nI have some little quibbles with the money trap page, looking over it quickly; for instance, tattoos.  Most of my friends get tattoos for very personal, intimate reasons, and collaborate with the tattoo artist (or else do it themselves).  I believe it can be a form of spiritual expression.  There are actually many situations where I think that spending money might be necessary in order to receive certain benefits, although I agree that it should be minimized; for instance, my trip to Japan was extremely enlightening; I was able to stay with my best friend's family and be immersed in that culture, enriching the ties between us and exposing myself to an energy and overall feeling that I would never have felt before.  I still have dreams that take place in Japan; it has become a more concrete part of my internal world.  The ideal would be if we could all barter with concrete objects or specific exchanges; I think specialization is necessary in order for us to achieve certain heights of human expression.  I'll be honest.  I have no interest in understanding electronics.  But my dad is a master of them, and I appreciate that skill; I, on the other hand, have certain emotional tools and an extremely high degree of artistic skill.  He, too, appreciates these things about me.  People have natural inclinations, and should follow and master these things, I think.  Even someone who is able to perform a variety of skills at a low-level is an important member of a community, able to substitute themselves when others are sick or absent; think of the specialized cells of the body, keeping the macro-organism alive.  Human culture is like that, as well; more complicated and richer.  The abstraction present in money does allow for a certain amount of evil, corruption, stress, and lack of efficiency; as when we get 'depressions' in the economy because people build off of value that does not yet exist, or that will never exist.  But I think specialization or exchange of labors is not necessarily good; if I have a friend who has an amazing talent for engineering, I will gladly trade them my labor or skills for theirs.  I think we can build a complex society off of the basic principles that you espouse.  We need to organize into smaller social units, maybe, like tribes, so that there will be the trust and organization-minus-bureaucracy necessary to facilitate such exchanges.  No?  Maybe.\nObviously, I am so word-y and exhaustively reflective that the length of your frames is not nearly so wild, and thus, quite manageable.  I thank you.","student":"Mary Blaise Turgeon","tutorial":"Enjoy Life Set 4 Money and Happiness.txt","frame":35}
{"feedback":"What if I am more of a fan of Jung than Freud, eh?  What if I feel there are other more complicated factors at play; archetypes and the collective unconscious?  A vast reservoir of unsorted but absorbed information in our subconscious? Furthermore, at the very beginning of this series, you presented that we can not know what other people are feeling; perhaps, philosophically, this is true, and yet, assuming that we can know anything, I know that I feel sensitivities to certain energies of other people.  I can tell what they are feeling, empathetically.  Whether this is through some 'magic' such as 'auras', or through subtle pheromonal and gestural cues paired with my knowledge of the subject and my self, does not matter.  I am often told that I 'know what to say', I am often relied upon for answers, because I search deep inside myself and there they are.  I have found ideas and images that I later comprehend in the works of great masters; but for me they were subconscious, and not, as far as I know, something I had ever been exposed to, before; although obviously we are exposed to a great deal in our lives, I believe it is possible to independently arrive at the same conclusions, or else how could the 'original' person have come up with it?  We are all drawing our own ability to synthesize new information or understanding, the human self.  Of course, I understand what you are saying.  It's a good enough model for what you are trying to get across, and doesn't entirely disagree with what I am trying to communicate.  I am just not entirely in agreement with the specifics; my experience of life and of myself feels much more complex.\nYou'll notice in some of my earlier answers, I noted some of my other disagreements.  If culture, if the desire to consider others and some form of empathy, were not inherent capabilities in human development; how could culture have ever developed, unless it was introduced by some outside force?  Even animals exhibit varying degrees of co-operation and conflict.  But perhaps I am just talking for the sake of talking; there are so many things to consider, in life, and obviously we can't say it all in a single statement; except, I suppose, for 'aum'.","student":"merry blaze sturgeon","tutorial":"Enjoy Life Set 5 Your personalities.txt","frame":38}

There were two items that I thought need clarification. First, getting a tattoo struck me as an odd item to focus on. This doesn't seem like a recurrent money trap, and unless it's done purely for approval, it seems like it might have some artistic merit. I would also argue that pets might be a good source of companionship and meaningful in their own right. At least some clarification about why each item is a money trap might be helpful.
