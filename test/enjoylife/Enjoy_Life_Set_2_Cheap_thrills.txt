When talking about enjoying life, we are dealing with a difficult subject matter.  A positive "state of mind" is your reaction to having accomplished something well.  "Satisfaction" is a byproduct of what behavioral scientists call "operant conditioning."  For example, when you finish a task like washing up dirty dishes, mowing the lawn, preparing a delicious recipe, buffing something to a high shine, or shovelling out the driveway, you survey what you have just done and feel a sense of accomplishment and "well-being."  It is more subtle and pervading and we might prefer to call this a _______  __  _______ rather than a "feeling."
