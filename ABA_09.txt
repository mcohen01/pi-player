Overview: The following frames continue to discuss the notion of the conditioned reflex and include the concepts of the unconditioned and conditioned response. They require that you use the Exhibit for Set 9.


READ THE EXHIBIT NINE FIRST.  The room in (B) is designed to (increase/reduce) _______ uncontrolled factors that might affect the experimental result.

In (G), little or no conditioning would have occurred if the tone had preceded the food by more than a few seconds.  The INTERVAL between the stimulus-to-be-conditioned and the unconditioned stimulus must be rather (short/long) _______.
