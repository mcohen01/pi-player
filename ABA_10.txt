Overview: Ivan Pavlov was an excellent physiologist but was not a psychologist by training. His experiments were originally conducted to study processes in the brain. But in attempting to do so he discovered what is now called "respondent" conditioning. (This type of conditioning is sometimes called "reflexive conditioning" or "classical conditioning.") The present set describes one of Pavlov's experiments with dogs. They require that you use the Exhibit for Set 10.



Read Exhibit 10 and refer to it as needed.  In experiment 1 [see Exhibit 10], the food powder is a(n) _______  ________ for salivation.
