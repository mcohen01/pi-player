Reflexes were originally fixed and not conditionable.  There was no possibility of learning within the lifetime of an organism.  This is why many millions of species went extinct when the environment (was stable/rapidly changed) _______.

Suppose the climate trended colder and some green things turned red--yet still remained edible.

@begin
You will recall that respondent behavior is elicited by prior stimuli.  Suppose a genetic mutation occurred that made it it more likely to eat red objects if they occurred next to green ones (i.e., they were paired together). By the process of green occurring together with red, red now ALSO comes to elicit eating the objects.  As you learned in the previous set of frames, this genetic variation or mutation marked the appearance of _______t conditioning in the behavior patterns of the animal because a novel stimulus also elicits the eating reflex.
