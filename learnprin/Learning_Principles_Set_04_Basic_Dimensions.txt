"White lies" are common; nearly all people misrepresent themselves now and then.  We can overlook this without concern.  But it is a cause for action when individuals frequently distort the truth.

Another dimension of operant behavior is DURATION.  Buttons to operate devices require some minimal force or threshold to push.

Two events are "contiguous" when they occur adjacent to each other in time, sometimes overlapping.  In an earlier segment of this program you learned that fierce growling comes to elicit the respondent withdrawal reflex when paired with a painful bite.

In the past, dinner was announced by a dinner bell.  The bell elicited a little salivation.  Those hearing it began to salivate a little when they heard the bell due to previous respondent conditioning.  This happened because the food and the bell were c______usly paired in the past.

Restaurants sometimes hand out devices that blink and vibrate to announce that your table is ready.  Blinking and vibrating can result in both respondent and operant behavior on your part.  This device may _______t salivation in the same manner as a dinner bell.

Being ushered to a table, seeing others eating food, and the aroma of food, were contiguously paired with the blinking light.  The blinking light acquired the ability to elicit a little salivation.  But it simultaneously reinforces the behavior of watching for it to blink.   Watching for the blinking light is supported by its consequences.  We have a high pr_______y of watching the device because blinking reinforces that (operant/respondent) _______ behavior.  (two answers)

When you first learned to tie your shoes, you were taught by someone who demonstrated how to take the two laces each in a separate hand.

The probability of behavior is not strengthened when the reinforcer is delayed.  Immediacy is critical.  For example, some people rarely make oatmeal from scratch.  Instead, they stir the contents of a packet into a bowl and microwave it.  Even though microwaved oatmeal isn't the same quality as oatmeal made from scratch the critical variable is the i________y of reinforcement.
