When a stimulus "forces" or "elicits" your response, technically speaking, we call your response as "respondent."

New reflexes are acquired via the process called "conditioning."  The process is often called "classical" conditioning, however, we will refer to it as "respondent conditioning."

This process is called respondent _______.
