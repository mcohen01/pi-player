There is a reason why this form of instruction surpasses the behaviors of passively listening or reading.  Each screen/frame of material has been deliberately constructed to strengthen your developing memory when you struggle a little to supply an answer.  It will cause you to study all the words in each frame carefully.  (True or false?) _______

Some users of this program report a strong tendency for their eyes to go directly to the blank(s) when a new frame appears without reading everything.  DON'T DO THIS because this will lower your score.  Read the entire frame content before you attempt an answer because concepts/words introduced in one frame often become the answers for the next frame.  You should (a or b?) ___  a. Race through the program as fast as you can, or b.  Study the content of each frame carefully.

But here is a new twist.  Very often the CONSEQUENCES of what you do influence what you do and how you feel.  For example, you find a key that works for a lock and later you use that key again.
