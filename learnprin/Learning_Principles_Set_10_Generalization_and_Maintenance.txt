You could discriminate between a dog and a cat when the pictures used to teach you remained the same each time.  But not all cats look alike.  They are big and small, come in different colors and patterns, have long and short hair, and so on.  By reinforcing your response "cat" to a variety of shapes and colors you were then taught to (generalize across/discriminate between) __________ a variety of cats.

Subsequently, you secretly feed the fish a little before "fishing time."  So, not every time the children toss baited lines into the tank do they catch a fish.
