The technical phrase "contiguous pairing" means that things come together at the same time.  "Contiguous" [note the spelling of this word carefully, i.e., con tig u ous] is close to meaning "simultaneous."  Hearing a dinner bell and the presence of dinner is an example of c_____s pairing.

The teacher might then prompt the student with the direction "Say microscope" as the student looks at the object.  When, in the presence of the microscope, the student's response "microscope" receives teacher approval, a contingency of ______ has been arranged.
