Each important intraverbal connection should be conditioned separately.  To make sure an intraverbal relationship is strengthened, the student must _____tly (rather than covertly) respond with a key word.

Multiple examples within a frame, (regardless of whether the rule is presented first or last) are multiple prompts.  The successive frames early in a program should contain (many/few) ______ examples to raise the probability of a correct response to the maximum.

The amount of prompting changes, however, in a good frame sequence.  Review of many familiar illustrations or cases strengthens the tendency to give a correct rule.  But the number of _____s, as forms of primes and prompts, should slowly decrease from frame to frame.

Induction, the formulation of a rule by inspecting examples first, is a slow process.  A student's initial statements of a rule may be faulty, ill-stated, or fragmented.  This (slows down/speeds up) ______ learning by allowing errors.
