A frame is a "context."  It is an environment; a set of circumstances.  It is a (foreground/background) _______ against which a student is to emit a response.

The "answer" to the frame is the missing element.  A program can systematically change the "background" while repeatedly asking for and strengthening the same response.  In doing so it is inducing what is technically called generalization of the ______.

Much of what a programmer is trying to get the student to say can already be said by the student.  But the "connections" between some of the words, phrases, or sentences are (weak/strong) ______ in the student's repertoire.

These intraverbal connections are strengthened by repeatedly presenting the terms together while getting the student to respond overtly to them.  In other words, the program induces the student to actively _____y the same thing.

Usually, an intraverbal connection is not firmly established by one reinforcement.  Therefore, the student is asked to respond to a set of stimuli in (only a few ways/a variety of ways) ______.

@graphic none

@begin
Intraverbal connections become firmly established when students respond to stimuli in a variety of ways.  For example, a frame early in a series that teaches the rule--"Look before you leap" might contain:  Look before you _______.  But a later frame might then present:  _______ before you leap.  [Ignore the above blanks.]  The responses "look" and "leap" are being separately strengthened to firmly establish intraverbal _____ns.

A frame early in a series that teaches the rule--"Look before you leap" might contain:  Look before you _______.  But a later frame might then present:  _______ before you leap.

A subordinate objective of such a program is to strengthen saying the entire phrase when one is on the verge of saying ei____r of the responses "look" or "leap."
