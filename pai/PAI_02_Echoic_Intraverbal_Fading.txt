One important goal in programmed instruction is to strengthen the student's echoic behavior because this sets the stage for responding correctly when echoic or textual stimuli (are present/are not present) ______.

INTRAVERBAL behavior is more difficult to establish because it is not simply echoing a stimulus.  When one is asked "What is two plus two?" the appropriate response is not the echoic response of saying "What is two plus two?" but is instead saying "four."  Saying "four" (is/is not) _______ an echoic response.

Getting a child to count by "ones" involves strengthening his tendency to say "three" after he says "one, two,..." Since the verbal response "three" is different from the verbal stimulus "one, two,..." it is not an echoic response but instead an ______ response.

Instructional frames induce the learner to behave verbally in the same way the programmer does.  A program progressively strengthens the learner's tendency to say the same things by c_____y pairing words or phrases with other words or phrases.

To teach a child to count, a parent contiguously pairs the stimulus "one, two,..." with the response "three."  Here, the child first emits _____c behavior by copying the chain of responses.

Later, the parent reduces the intensity of the word "three" while the child responds "three."  The parent, in doing so, is _____ing out a prompt.

Intraverbal behavior is more difficult to establish if the learner (does/does not) _______ already respond strongly to the words heard or read.
