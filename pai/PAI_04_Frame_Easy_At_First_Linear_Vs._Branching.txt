Answers a programmer does not expect are called errors.  But when a student emits an error, that response has a relatively (high/low) ______ probability, or else it would fail to be emitted.

The probability of a student's response is determined by a history of conditioning as well as the current frame material.  A programmer can firmly establish a new _____y of conditioning by carefully arranging a series of frames.

The programmer can also carefully select the material he or she places in the current frame.  Therefore, most so-called "wrong" answers are largely the responsibility of the ______ and are not the fault of the student.

Years ago, a controversy existed between advocates of what was called "linear" programming and "branching" programming. A program that presented frames in a predefined sequence, regardless of the student's responses, is called (linear/branching) ______.

Making an error is aversive to most of us.  A branching program which not only allows, but anticipates, errors will not be as reinforcing as a well-developed ______ program, because the student may often be wrong.

Branching programs frequently employ multiple-choice "foils."  If the student selects the correct answer she moves forward in the program.  If she selects a "foil" she is br_____ed to remedial frames and then brought back to the main program frame series.

A "good" multiple-choice foil is one that is plausible, yet wrong; it is a discrimination test.  But during the early stages of instruction, the student may respond weakly to the correct answer, and seeing plausible foils could _____crease the tendency to emit wrong answers.

There are occasions where multiple-choices are appropriate in a linear program--perhaps to verify already learned responses or for review.  But because they can strengthen wrong answers, multiple-choice sequences (should/should not) ______ be used in instructional programs.
