Overview: Some of what you do is involuntary behavior. Frames in this set teach the concept of the unconditioned and conditioned reflex. The terms--stimulus, response, reflex, latency, magnitude, and intensity are introduced along with the functional relationships discovered by Pavlov, the Russian physiologist.



During a health examination, a doctor may check how you respond to stimuli.  He (or she) may tap your knee patellar tendon) with a rubber hammer to test your ref____es.
